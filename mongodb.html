        <h1>MongoDB Introduction</h1>
        <p>MongoDB is the most popular NoSQL open source document-oriented database. The term 'NoSQL' means 'non-relational'.</p>
        <h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Document Oriented: MongoDB stores the main subject in the minimal number of documents and not by breaking it into multiple relational structures like RDBMS. For example, it stores all the information of a computer in a single document called Computer and not in distinct relational structures like CPU, RAM, Hard disk etc.</li>
            
            <li> Scalability: MongoDB scales horizontally using sharding (partitioning data across various servers). Data is partitioned into data chunks using the shard key and these data chunks are evenly distributed across shards that reside across many physical servers.</li>
        
            
            <li> Aggregation: Aggregation operations process data records and return the computed results. It is similar to the GROUPBY clause in SQL. A few aggregation expressions are sum, avg, min, max, etc.</li>
            
              
            
            </ul>
