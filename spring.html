        <h1>Spring Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Spring Framework is a powerful, lightweight, and widely used Java framework for building enterprise applications. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for Java-based applications, making development faster, scalable, and maintainable.</p>
        <h2>What is Spring?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Simplified Development: Spring reduces boilerplate code with features like Dependency Injection and AOP, making development faster and easier.</li>
            
            <li> Loose Coupling: Dependency Injection ensures components are loosely coupled, improving maintainability and testability.</li>
        
            
              <li> Integration Support: Spring provides built-in support for various technologies like JDBC, JMS, and JPA, making integration with other systems seamless.</li>
